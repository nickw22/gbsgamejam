/**
 * @class Actor
 *
 * @brief Actor - The Actor class is used to represent a game world object. You do not generally create actors directly, instead 
 * you derive your own class from Actor and implement Update() and Render() methods in your own class to provide custom 
 * functionality. Note that you do not need to implement the Render() method unless you are planning on either augmenting
 * the existing render method (changing graphics states etc..) or replacing it with your own custom rendering to support additional 
 * features (see Label for an example).
 *
 * The Actor has the following features:
 * - An ID, this allows you to identify actors by unique ID or group ID
 * - 3D Position, Scale and Rotation
 * - A 3D model to represent the actor visually
 * - A collision sphere that is used by the World system to determine if the actor has been touched
 * - Visible property that determines if the actor is visible
 * - Touchable property that determines if the actor can receive touch events
