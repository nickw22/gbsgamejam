/**
 * @class World
 *
 * @brief World - The World class is responsible for maintaining a list of world objects (actors). You can derive your own World object 
 * from this class to provide custom functionality.
 *
 * The World has the following features:
 * - Manages a group of game objects
 * - Manages world camera
 * - Supports touched actor feature. When an actor is touched it will be notified by the actors Event_BeginTouch() and Event_EndTouch() methods
 *
 * Its generally best to derive your own world object from World and implement the Init(), Release(), Update() and Render() methods. These 
 * methods should provide the following functionality
 * - Init() - Initialise the world
 * - Release() - Release and clean-up the world (automatically releases all actors that were added to the world)
 * - Update() - Performs per game frame update (Also updates all actors that were added to the world)
 * - Render() - Performs per game frame rendering (Also renders all actors that were added to the world)
 *
 * A world contains a list of game objects (actors). Below shows an example of how to create and add an actor to the world:
 *
 * @code
 *     Actor* actor = new Actor();
 *     world->AddActor(actor);
 * @endcode
 *
